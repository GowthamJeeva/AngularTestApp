Working Procedure:

1.clone the project or download it.
 2.Install Angular CLI globally(npm install -g @angular/cli) from nodeJS cmd,make sure you have NodeJs installed,you may need admin rights.
  3. Goto project root location(where bin,src and other folders are there).
  4.Run "npm install" from nodejs cmd it will take time to install the project dependencies.
  5.Run "ng build".
  6.After step 5 gets completed goto bin->services and run node webapp.service.js
  7.Run "localhost:6002" in browser and check the functionality.

  Note:For every changes in application you made,again do from steps 5(if you are not using 'ng build --watch' and 'nodemon webapp.service.js' - it will load the changes automatically)
